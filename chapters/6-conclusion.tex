\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conclusion}

During my six-month internship at Tarides, I discovered Irmin and its internals--both by submitting general-purpose pull requests to the repository and by implementing a simplified model of Irmin from scratch~\cite{irmin-toy-github}. I also reviewed garbage collection literature to identify the key concepts and algorithms in the field. I then tried to adapt some of the ideas from literature into a set of garbage collection schemes that would make sense in the context of Irmin. This was a harder problem than expected, because some usual assumptions about garbage collection in the context of memory-managed programming languages did not apply to data stores like Irmin. Eventually, I designed and implemented a \textit{modular} tracing collector which allows different Irmin backends to reclaim unreachable objects differently depending on how they store objects; I designed a simple and efficient \textit{concurrent collection} scheme for Git-based data stores by taking advantage of the immutability of most objects; I tried reducing the memory overhead of garbage collection by proposing several \textit{partial collection} schemes with different time and space trade-offs; and I finally spent some time designing and evaluating different implementations of the \texttt{filter} primitive for pack-like backends. There are still areas of active work, notably to port some of my schemes to \texttt{irmin}, and to better take advantage of generational information in the backends.

As a closing note, I would like to really thank my colleagues at Tarides for their warm welcome, especially given the special circumstances of the last couple of months. Thanks in particular to Clément, Thomas, Craig and Ioana for their help and guidance on Irmin, as well as their help on this report.
