val cleanup : ?roots:[ `Branches | `List of commit list ] ->
              ?limit_count:int -> ?limit_time:float -> t ->

(** [cleanup t] runs the garbage collector on the object graph of database [t].
    Every commit, node and blob which is not reachable from [?roots] will be deleted.

    The garbage collector is concurrent, so collection can safely be interleaved with
    other database operations. This is done via two mechanisms:
    - the Lwt thread of the collector will yield on every I/O operation to allow other
      threads to execute while waiting for results;
    - the [?limit_count] and [?limit_time] options force the collector to return after
      processing more than a set number of objects or after running for a set number 
      of seconds. In this case, the function will return [Error `Run_again], and it
      will need to be run again at a later time to finish collection. *)
