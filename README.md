LaTeX sources for my Master thesis on the garbage collection of a decentralized data store.

### Abstract.

This thesis summarizes my internship work designing and implementing a garbage collection scheme for [Irmin](https://irmin.org/), a decentralized database library written in OCaml. It explores both the theoretical aspects of garbage collection and the practical challenges that come with implementation--mainly regarding pause time and memory efficiency.

### Acknowledgements.

This thesis is the result of a six-month internship at [Tarides](https://tarides.com/) under the supervision of Clément Pascutto.  
It will be evaluated as part of my joint Master's degree between ENS de Lyon and EPFL.
